debug(invitations): add logging to diagnose 403 errors after accepting

Adding comprehensive logging to identify why users get 403 errors
when accessing household details immediately after accepting invitation.

Debug logs added:
- AcceptInvitation route: Log requester userId/email before acceptance
- AcceptInvitation route: Log success with householdId/role/userId
- GetHouseholdOverviewUseCase: Log access check parameters
- GetHouseholdOverviewUseCase: Log whether member was found

This will help identify if the issue is:
1. userId mismatch between accept and subsequent requests
2. Race condition (member not yet visible)
3. Transaction not properly committed

Temporary logging for production debugging - will be removed once root cause identified.
