fix(invitations): make resolve and accept endpoints public for guest users

Root cause of authentication errors:
- Users accepting invitations are not yet household members
- They don't have authentication context when clicking email links
- /resolve and /accept endpoints were requiring full authentication
- This blocked the entire invitation acceptance flow

Solution:
- Add invitation endpoints to public list in authContext plugin:
  * /v1/invitations/accept-link (already public)
  * /v1/households/invitations/resolve (now public)
  * /v1/households/invitations/accept (now public with manual auth extraction)

- Update /accept endpoint to manually extract auth headers from request
- Auth headers still required for /accept but validated in handler not globally
- /resolve endpoint fully public (no auth needed to view invitation details)

Changes:
- src/plugins/authContext.ts: Add invitation endpoints to publicEndpoints array
- src/routes/households/invitationRoutes.ts: Manual auth extraction in /accept handler

User flow now works:
1. User clicks email link → redirects to app (no auth needed)
2. App calls /resolve to fetch invitation details (no auth needed)
3. User logs in/signs up → app gets auth headers from Supabase
4. App calls /accept with auth headers → member created successfully

This fixes "authentication context is missing" errors during invitation acceptance.
